## Deep Q Network (DQN) Agent Application
#### Lunar Lander Game
* Built DQN agent in Luna Lander environment for training and get 201 rewards for sequential 100 trials. I also show how hyper-parameters like α (learning rate), ε and γ have effect on learning performance (rewards). Different curves for different hyperparameters are also provided.

#### Power Management System
* Built an optimized 4-layer DQN agent using Keras in Python to manage the frequency levels for different CPU cores and a novel prioritized experience replay technique and a reward function for effective training of the DQN.


### Prerequisites

* For DQN implementation for the agent of Lunar Lander, [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) has to be installed to run. My DQN-based agent will be converged in 5000 episodes.
* The inputs for DQN implementation for SoC is removed due to privacy, the results are shown in the paper.

### Running the Tests
All results for each project are shown in **Report.pdf** and corresponding paper.
